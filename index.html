                <div class="bio-text">
                    <p><strong>Marcus Aurelius</strong> was born in 121 CE in Rome and rose from a noble family to become emperor of the Roman Empire. Adopted by Emperor Antoninus Pius, he was trained in governance and philosophy from a young age.</p>
                    <p>He ruled from 161 to 180 CE, navigating wars, plagues, and political unrest with calm wisdom. His reign is remembered for his Stoic leadership and his private writings, <em>Meditations</em>, which continue to inspire readers with insights on duty, discipline, and inner peace.</p>
                    <p>Marcus Aurelius is revered not only as a powerful ruler, but as a philosopher-king who embodied the very virtues he preached: patience, reason, humility, and strength of character.</p>

              <div class="philosophy-point">
                <h3>1. Stoicism and Control</h3>
                <p><strong>Focus on what you can control:</strong> Only your thoughts, actions, and reactions are within your control. Let go of the rest.</p>
                <p><strong>Acceptance of fate:</strong> Embrace whatever comes as part of nature’s plan, and find peace in that acceptance.</p>
              </div>
          
              <div class="philosophy-point">
                <h3>2. Virtue as the Highest Good</h3>
                <p><strong>Live in accordance with nature:</strong> Align your actions with wisdom, justice, courage, and moderation.</p>
                <p><strong>Virtue is its own reward:</strong> A meaningful life is built on character, not status or pleasure.</p>

              <div class="philosophy-point">
                <h3>4. Impermanence of Life</h3>
                <p><strong>Memento mori:</strong> Remember that life is short. Let that shape your priorities and gratitude.</p>
                <p><strong>Embrace the present:</strong> The only time you truly have is now. Live it fully and intentionally.</p>
